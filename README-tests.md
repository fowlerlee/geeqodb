Server Tests: ✅ While server_test.zig is referenced in main_test.zig, I don't see detailed tests for server functionality like connection handling, protocol parsing, or error handling.
SQL Parser Tests: ✅ Added comprehensive tests in parser_test.zig for SQL parsing functionality, covering various SQL statements including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, CREATE INDEX, DROP INDEX, and complex queries with subqueries, CTEs, JOINs, and window functions.
Client Library Tests: No tests for client libraries or connection handling.
Replication Tests: ✅ Added comprehensive unit tests in vr_test.zig for the Viewstamped Replication implementation, covering node initialization, primary election, request processing, replication between nodes, view changes, node recovery, and multiple operations across a cluster.
Backup and Recovery Tests: ✅ Added comprehensive tests in backup_recovery_test.zig for database backup and recovery operations, covering backup creation, verification, recovery from backups, point-in-time recovery using WAL, recovery after crashes, incremental backups, backups during active transactions, recovery with corrupted backup files, and recovery with partial WAL.
Authentication and Authorization Tests: No tests for user authentication or access control.
Concurrency Control Tests: ✅ Comprehensive tests for transaction isolation levels (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable) and concurrency control mechanisms including tests for dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads, lost updates, write skew, and deadlock detection.
Schema Management Tests: No tests for schema creation, modification, or validation.
Index Tests: ✅ No tests for index creation, usage, or maintenance.
Query Optimization Tests: While there's a planner_test.zig, detailed tests for query optimization strategies appear limited.

Compaction Tests: No dedicated tests for storage compaction operations.
Monitoring and Metrics Tests: No tests for monitoring functionality.
Distributed Query Tests: No tests for distributed query execution.
