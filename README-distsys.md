1. Replica Management 
Create a ReplicaState enum (PRIMARY, BACKUP, RECOVERING, VIEW_CHANGE)
Implement state transition logic
Design a replica registry to track all nodes
2. View Change Protocol
Implement view number tracking
Create view change triggering (heartbeat/timeout mechanism)
Implement view change request/response messages
Add view change completion and new primary election
3. Distributed Log Replication 
Modify WAL to support distributed operation
Implement PrepareOK acknowledgments
Create commit point tracking across replicas
Add operation forwarding from backups to primary
4. Recovery Mechanism (2 weeks)
Implement state transfer for recovering replicas
Add checkpoint creation for efficient recovery
Create recovery request/response protocol
Implement catch-up mechanism for lagging replicas
5. Consensus Implementation (3 weeks)
Implement quorum calculation
Add sequence number generation and tracking
Create operation acknowledgment mechanism
Implement operation commitment logic
Testing Plan
1. Unit Tests
Test state transitions for individual replicas
Verify log entry format and storage
Test quorum calculations
Validate checkpoint creation and management
2. Integration Tests
Test primary-to-backup communication
Verify view change under normal conditions
Test recovery of a single node
3. Fault Injection Tests
Simulate primary failure and test view change
Test network partitions
Introduce message delays/drops
Test simultaneous node failures
4. Performance Tests
Measure throughput under various workloads
Test latency for different operation types
Evaluate recovery time for different failure scenarios
Benchmark view change duration
5. Distributed Consensus Tests
Verify linearizability of operations
Test concurrent client operations
Verify consistency across replicas after recovery
Test split-brain prevention
